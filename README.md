# rock-paper-scissors

Once again, it is late at night and I am working on another [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) assignment.

This time, we are greeted with rock paper scissors. But have you seen a project of mine that doesn't involve **PENGUINS**?

> You probably have. But uh, for the sake of dramatic effect - 

**THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HAVEN'T**!

As such, you are now about to have one of the experiences of all time: playing rock-paper-scissors with a ❄️PENGUIN!❄️
